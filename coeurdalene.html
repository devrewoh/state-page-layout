            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Coeur d'Alene is the largest city in North Idaho. Coeur d'Alene is considered a satelite city of Spokane, which is located about thirty miles to the west of the state of Washington.</p>
            <p>The city is named after the Coeur d'Alene people, a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans who lived along the rivers and lakes of the region, in a territory of 4,000,000 acreas from eastern Washington to Montana. The native people were hunter-gatherers who used the seasons to their advantage to forage for food, fish and hunt.</p>

			<p>The city had started to grow when miners and prospectors began to find silver and gold within the region and what would eventually become known as Silver Valley. The city has also grown largely due to the timber industry and tourism over the past century.</p>

            <p>Did you know that Idaho produces approximately 1/3 of all U.S. potatoes? This is all thanks to the climate and fertile volcanic soils! Idaho is also a large producer of wheat, barley, hay, sugarbeets, seeds, onions, lentils, beans and more! <br><br><i>Source:<a href="https://agri.idaho.gov/main/about/about-idaho-agriculture/idaho-crops/" target="_blank">Idaho State Department of Agriculture</i></a>

            <p>The following are rubric requirements that I have had a very difficult time placing into my project as I was designing the layout in a certain way that made sense to me. These tools are more dated and seem counter productive to me as they don't synergize well with my established layout as I was aiming to achieve fluid responsive with intelligent design. I am using a duplicate logo for my image to meet the relative and absolute positioning requirements. Overall I am very happy with my progress on this project as it has been absolutely aggrivating at times but a valuable lesson in Git and version control.</p>
